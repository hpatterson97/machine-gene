#' @description This is code that performs rejection sampling on a continuous random variable
#' @param n the number of samples
#' @param jpdf a function that is the joint pdf of the random variable from which you want to sample. Should use x and y.
#' @param a a numeric that is the lower bound of the random variable you wish to sample from
#' @param b a numeric that is the upper bound of the random variable you wish to sample from
#' @param C a numeric that is such that f(x) â‰¤ C for all values of x and y
#' @return a random sample of coordinate pairs
